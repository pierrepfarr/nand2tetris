### Overview
The following is a simple quidditch game based on Harry Potter. The user must pilot the Broomstick (seeker) to the Snitch and avoid the two roaming Buldgers. 

### Usage

To run the file, load the vm code generated from the compiler into the VM emulator and run the code. There will be a brief pop-up and you will be told to press a key to start (this seeds the random number generation). Play the game to a score of 10. 

If you wish to exit early just press q!


## Citation 

As suggested by the professor I have borrowed the random number generation code from Erik Umble's DinoAdventure (https://github.com/ErikUmble/nand2tetris/blob/main/DinoAdventure/src/Pterodactyl.jack).
